# Exo_Mist
Analyzing star data from the MAST Catalogue to identify prominent periodic signals, which are crucial for detecting potential exoplanets. By applying the transit method, this analysis focuses on recognizing the subtle dimming of a star's light caused by an orbiting planet passing in front of it. These periodic signals serve as key indicators, allowing us to predict and confirm the existence of exoplanets, contributing significantly to our understanding of planetary systems beyond our own. This method enhances the search for new worlds by providing a more reliable approach to exoplanet discovery.
