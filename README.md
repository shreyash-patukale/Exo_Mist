  # Exo_Mist
Analyzing star data from the MAST Catalogue to identify prominent periodic signals, which are crucial for detecting potential exoplanets. By applying the transit method, this analysis focuses on recognizing the subtle dimming of a star's light caused by an orbiting planet passing in front of it. These periodic signals serve as key indicators, allowing us to predict and confirm the existence of exoplanets, contributing significantly to our understanding of planetary systems beyond our own. This method enhances the search for new worlds by providing a more reliable approach to exoplanet discovery.

# Prediction

## 1. BLS power graph
In our application, the BLS power graph is used to analyze the periodic light curves of stars, aiding in the detection of potential exoplanets through the transit method. By identifying fluctuations in a star’s brightness, the graph helps highlight the subtle dimming caused by an exoplanet passing in front of its host star, allowing us to detect and confirm the presence of exoplanets.

## 2. Normalized Flux Graph
In our application, the Normalized Flux Graph is used to represent the star's light curve, where the flux values are normalized to a reference level. This allows us to detect small variations in brightness, helping to identify potential exoplanet transits with greater accuracy, by removing any constant background noise and focusing on relative changes in brightness.

## 3. Flux (e⁻ s⁻¹) Graph
The Flux (e⁻ s⁻¹) Graph represents the star’s light intensity in terms of electron count per second (e⁻ s⁻¹). This graph provides precise measurements of light variations over time, which are essential for identifying periodic dips in brightness that may signal the presence of an exoplanet passing across the star’s disk, aiding in the detection process.
